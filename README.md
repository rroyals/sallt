# Sallt
Virtualized XRP Wallet

**Description**:  Sallt is an open-source XRP (XRP Ledger) software wallet. The main goal of Sallt is to provide enhanced security while maintaining lightweight. Sallt improves on traditional software wallets by introducing *virtualized signing, external private key storage, and end-to-end encryption* that allows for a much more secure experience. As with any software wallet, the security of the host machine remains a responsibility of the end user.

‎


**How It Works**: Sallt attempts to close the gap between hardware and software wallets through its advanced signing mechanism.

‎
*Sallt is currently in its early developmental stages while  virtualized signing remains merely as a Proof-of-Concept*
